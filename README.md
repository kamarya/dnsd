# DNSd

DNSd is a daemon a.k.a. service for Unix-like systems. It provides a local DNS backend complying (partially) with [RFC 1035](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt) in order to forward the queries/answers to/from Google Public DNS over HTTPS.

> Google Public DNS offers DNSSEC-validating resolution over an encrypted HTTPS connection. DNS-over-HTTPS greatly enhances privacy and security between a client and a recursive resolver, and complements DNSSEC to provide end-to-end authenticated DNS lookups.

### Highlights
 - Ultra lightweight (disk and memory footage).
 - Full functionality behind the web proxy out of the box.
 - Minimalistic implementation approach.
 - Highly configurable through a simple config. file.
 - A Self contained package that depends only on [libcurl](https://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/).
 - Supported records are **A**,**AAAA**,**CNAME**,**NS** and **MX**.

# Build and Install
Build the software by running the following commands in the terminal.
```
make
make install
```
You may run the service in the background (as a daemon) by setting the config file path as follows.
```
dnsd -f /etc/dnsd.conf
```
After the daemon is successfully loaded, the local DNS service is available on the regular DNS port 53.
If you are behind a web proxy server, you need to set its address and port in the configuration file.

If you would like to add DNSd as a service on your Linux machine, install the launcher (init and systemd) configuration files.
```
make linux-service
systemctl daemon-reload
service dnsd start
```
### Verification
You can verify wether the service is accessible through ```host -va github.com localhost```.
```
